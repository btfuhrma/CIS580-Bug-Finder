Title: Bug Report - User Management Feature

Report ID: 001
Date: 2024-10-25
Reported By: user@example.com

Description:
This is a bug report for the user management feature. The login function fails when the user inputs an incorrect password. 

Expected Behavior:
When a user tries to log in with an incorrect password, they should receive a clear message indicating that their password is incorrect, without any leakage of information about the username.

Actual Behavior:
Currently, the system returns a generic "Incorrect password." message, but it does not specify whether the username was found or not. This could lead to security concerns as it does not prevent brute-force attacks effectively.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Call the `login` function with an existing username and an incorrect password.
2. Observe the output message.

Additional Information:
- The system uses the following user credentials:
    - Username: admin
    - Password: password
    - Email: admin@example.com
- Suggested improvement: 
    - Enhance the error handling in the `login` function to specify that if a username does not exist, a different message should be returned, such as "User not found." This will help in preventing username enumeration attacks.

Attachments:
- Screenshots or logs if available.
