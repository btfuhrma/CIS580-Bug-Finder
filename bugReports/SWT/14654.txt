Bug ID: 14654
Summary: [typing] Single line selection on triple-click
Description: This is a common and convenient behavior for text editors/IDEs which is missing. Would be nice to have it. Switching to keyboard and doing &quot;shift+arrow down&quot; seems like a lot more effort for achieving the same effect.
